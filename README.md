# 8-Puzzle-game
Solving 8-puzzle game with BFS, A*, IDS algorithms

The program reading file build-in as "intput.txt",
so you need your input file at the same directory with
the python files.

input file standart:

  num - Algorithm to be used:
  1 - IDS
  2 - BFS
  3 - A*
  
  num - size of board (N = root(N,N) ) 
  
  <0,1,2...,N^2> - initial state as sequence of numbers.
  you can order them as you want.
  "0" means empty square
